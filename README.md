# üì¶ Unistock - Inventory Management System

Unistock is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Laravel, Vue.js, Inertia.js, and Tailwind CSS. This platform was developed as a university project and serves as a simple and efficient inventory management system to help small and medium-sized businesses manage their stock.

## üìú Project History

Unistock was developed as part of a major project for our undergraduate degree at UNICENTRO. The project was created by me, Gabriel Marochi Schmidt, and Gabriel do Nascimento de Lima, and it represents the culmination of our studies and our shared passion for software development. Together, we designed and implemented a solution to address real-world challenges in inventory management, incorporating modern technologies and best practices.
